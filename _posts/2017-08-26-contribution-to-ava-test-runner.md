title: Contribution to AVA Test Runner

Test-driven development is one of those ideas that, as soon as I understood it, I knew I could never live without it again.

As someone who studied literature (B.A. and M.A.) before entering computer science, I'm thrilled by the idea of development beginning with simple plain-speaking declarations of what an as-yet-unwritten function is capable of. Function X returns 'Fizz' if the argument is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if it's divisible by 5, 'FizzBuzz' if it's divisible by both, and the number itself if it's divisible by neither. Put that into a series of tests and you have a scaffold for your coding tasks.

That's part of why I was so thrilled to have my first accepted open source contribution be to [AVA, a JavaScript test runner](https://github.com/avajs/ava) designed for speedy execution and less verbose output. AVA recently introduced a verbose mode for when users want a little more detail about their test results, and I agreed with the project maintainers that it didn't make sense to timestamp each test result unless the user was in watch mode. [So I updated the main library and it's accompanying unit tests](https://github.com/avajs/ava/pull/1557/files), and five days later my contribution was accepted. Pretty awesome feeling to contribute to code you genuinely find useful. I highly recommend it. üòÅ
