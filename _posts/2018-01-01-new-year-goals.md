title: New Year, New Goals
---

It's January 1, 2018, and I'm feeling pumped.

I accomplished and learned a lot last year. I learned a ton about Node, React, Redux, TDD, build tools, and so much more. I attended a JavaScript conference and several meetups. I made my first contribution to an open-source project.

This year I want to accomplish and learn even more. Here's my list:

* Learn enough Ruby and Ruby on Rails to build and deploy an app to Heroku.
* Learn enough Angular and TypeScript to build and deploy an app with AWS.
* Master the fundamentals of SQL, database design, and API design to round out my back-end knowledge.
* Make a minimum of six contributions to open-source projects.

Of course goals are no good without a plan of action. For Ruby & RoR, I'm going to go through Michael Hartl's free [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). I'm more interested in practical application than becoming a Ruby master anytime soon, so Hartl has the right emphasis on creating real-world projects. For Angular and TypeScript, I'll complete video courses on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io). I'm familiar with building apps using React so this shouldn't be a huge leap; the key is to push directly toward getting real-world experience deploying and maintaining an app.

And for back-end knowledge, I'll probably pick up experience as I work through the Rails course, but it would be good to work through some books too. Not sure which yet, but [these](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Queries-Mere-Mortals-Hands/dp/0321992474) [look](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Design-Mere-Mortals-Hands/dp/0321884493) [promising](https://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Cookbook-Scalability/dp/0596801688).
