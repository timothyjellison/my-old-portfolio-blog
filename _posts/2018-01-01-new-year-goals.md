title: New Year, New Goals
---

It's January 1, 2018, and I'm feeling pumped.

I accomplished and learned a lot last year. I learned a ton about Node, React, Redux, TDD, build tools, and so much more. I attended a JavaScript conference and several meetups. I made my first contribution to an open-source project.

This year I want to accomplish and learn even more. Here's my list:

* Learn enough Ruby and Ruby on Rails to build and deploy an app to Heroku.
* Learn enough Angular and TypeScript to build and deploy an app with AWS.
* Master the fundamentals of SQL, database design, and API design to round out my back-end knowledge.
* Make a minimum of six contributions to open-source projects.
