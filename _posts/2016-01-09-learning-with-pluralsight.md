At the end of 2015 I signed up for [Microsoft's Developer Network community](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) and received six free months of [Pluralsight membership](http://www.pluralsight.com). I'd never used Pluralsight and didn't know what it really had to offer.

Pluralsight is *amazing*. Tons of really well produced videos on every topic. This will keep me learning at a great pace for the next six months.

Yesterday I watched this really great presentation on Agile development by Jeremy Jarrell. The course is called 'Agile for One', and as the name implies it breaks down techniques like Kanban, Scrum, and Burnup charts in a way that makes sense for the solo developer. I've already been putting some of Jarrell's ideas into practice today and I feel much more in control of my coding efforts.

And there are all these other great courses to watch. This morning I've watched the first thirty minutes of a course on Angular and feel like I have a much better grasp of how the MVC model works. I'll throw some notes from that up on the blog soon. Until then, I highly recommend [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com).
