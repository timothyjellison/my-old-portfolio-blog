title: SCSS Partials
---

Today I didn't have as much time as I would have liked for [my Library App](https://github.com/timothyjellison/Library_App), so I just broke up the little styling I had into SCSS partials.

If you're unfamiliar, you can save your css into smaller modular pieces by naming your files with an underscore (_typography.scss, _layouts.scss, _reset.scss, for example) and then importing them all into an index.scss using the @import command. It's explained very well on [the Sass website](http://sass-lang.com/guide).

So I got that in place and its going to make organization of my styling much easier, plus it will be easy to pick and choose scss files I'd like to carry forward to future projects.

Every little step counts!
