I'm thinking about what I want to do in the second quarter of 2018 and as usual small questions lead to big questions that lead to Big Questions. To paraphrase Joe Armstrong, I asked for a banana and instead I got the banana and a gorilla holding the banana and the whole jungle too. But why not go exploring the jungle, now that it's here? Sometimes to know what to do next you need to think about *everything* that came before.&nbsp;

## In the beginning

Growing up I got my sense of self-worth from being a know-it-all. I liked being the smart kid. Answering questions in class, impressing teachers and other nerds: that was my bread and butter.

I must have been so obnoxious. My sincere retroactive apologies to all my teachers and classmates.&nbsp;

My knowledge was picked up here and there. It came from scattered reading and TV shows. I read the Guinness Book of World Records and the annual World Almanac for trivia facts. Rather than choose to be one thing—a science geek, a musician, a scholar—I lived on the surface of everything. That worked out pretty well for me as long as nobody outclassed me in any of those subjects.

But outclass me they did. In high school I met kids who were much better at science than me, so I moved away from science and gave myself entirely to music and writing. In college I met people who were far better at music than me, so I concentrated entirely on my literary studies. In grad school I met geniuses who could think and write with a facility that literally put me to shame.

Groucho Marx famously resigned from the Friar's Club of Beverly Hills with the words "I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member." That was exactly my attitude. If I couldn't be the best member of the group, I didn't want to be part of the group. I left the Ph.D. track at my grad school and started working a boring office job.

## Setting childish things aside

It was a problem of motivation. At root, I didn't want to be a good person or to contribute to society or even to make tons of money. *All I wanted was to be admired.*&nbsp;I've got a lot of baggage I could point to from my childhood to explain the origins of that desire, but it wouldn't excuse my slavish devotion to it for nearly thirty years. It was a childish desire and the only way to escape it was to grow up.&nbsp;

While working at that boring office job I discovered computer programming through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and&nbsp;[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). After writing my first website I knew this was the work I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

As I learned to code, I was wary of slipping into old habits. I needed to structure my learning in such a way that I would know more than&nbsp;*just enough*&nbsp;to get by. I consciously decided to emphasize depth over breadth. It's a decision that's served me well in every web development job I've served in since then.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

**But here's the big win, the real takeaway from this whole story:**&nbsp;I'm at peace with the fact there will always be better web developers than me. I'm still going to enjoy writing code even if I'm not the best programmer in the world and I don't know every programming language. It's a big group and I'm happy and proud to be a part of it, even if I'm not the best.

For a younger me, that last paragraph was unthinkable. It represents a true paradigm shift and a real victory.

## So what does this all have to do with Q2 of 2018?

The repressed returns in disguise. I'm looking back at [my post from the beginning of this year](https://www.timothyellison.com/blog/new-year-goals.1/) and shaking my head.
{: .present-before-paste}

I say I want to expand into Ruby and SQL and Angular and to contribute to six open source libraries. Which libraries? Who knows! I convince myself this knowledge would make me a more well-rounded programmer, but would it? Maybe a little, but not nearly as much as digging deeper into the domain-specific knowledge I already have.&nbsp;
{: .present-before-paste}

Let's just scrap all that and start over. Here's how I'm re-evaluating for Q2.
{: .present-before-paste}

I have this website, the one you're reading right now. It's OK but it's far from great. I'm going to use Q2 to make it great. I'm going to learn everything it takes to make this website great and then I'm going to execute on that knowledge. Maybe that will involve learning new languages and maybe it won't, but that doesn't matter because the goal has real value. What matters is digging in and getting it done. Q2 is about getting to know the specifics of this website inside and out. It's a time to recommit to being an expert in my chosen few areas rather than fret about being a beginner in a dozen areas.

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/),&nbsp;[Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/). I'm gonna learn the hell out of all of them by using them to their full potential on this website.

Like Chris and Dave say all the time on ShopTalk, "[Just build websites.](http://justbuildwebsites.com/)" That's exactly what I'm going to do, and I'm looking forward to sharing that journey here on the blog.
