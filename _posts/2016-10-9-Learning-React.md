title: Starting to Learn React
---

This last month I started working as a UI Developer at Comcast. It's a good challenge that I'm enjoying a lot.

One of the best things about the new job is that it's giving me a chance to learn React.

A month ago, I'd never read even a single line of React code. Now I'm making regular contributions to a great project that will make life easier for millions of Comcast customers.

Learning React is often mentioned in the context of "going full stack", but it's only the V in MVC. You don't have to program controllers. You don't have to manage a database and create an API. If you're a UI dev like me you can learn React and never leave the comfort of the good ol' front end.

React has its own lingo and best practices but it's all just JavaScript. Sometimes it feels more foreign than it needs to because we use a lot of ES6, but now that I've gotten the hang of ES6 I *love* it. Here's a super cool website where you can learn everything ES6 has to offer: [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org/)

Starting with React isn't easy by any stretch of the imagination, and the official documentation is clearly intended for more advanced coders. If you're getting started, I think it's best to use a scaffold like [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot). This will set up babel, webpack, Redux, and a bunch of other essential tools to get your environment up and running. That way you can just worry about code instead of fussing over config options.
