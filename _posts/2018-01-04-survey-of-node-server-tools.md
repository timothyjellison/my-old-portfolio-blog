So -- I tested out restify, loopback, hapi, and sails.

restify and hapi are lightweight, like express. hapi uses config objects, but is otherwise like express.

loopback is like a yeoman generator for apis. It provides a swagger-style interface for easily testing and visualizing your api.

sails is like rails for javascript. It's super opinionated and handles every aspect of the app, not just the back end.
