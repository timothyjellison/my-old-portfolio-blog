title: Little Improvements
---

This morning I added pagination to my site by following [this handy tutorial on jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/). It was really easy. Just added a single line of code to my _config.yml file and two blocks of code to my index.html. I didn't like the way their setup looked (it showed you the whole blog post right up front rather than an excerpt, and the date format had all kinds of information nobody needs like the minute and second I posted the content) so I tweaked it a bit. But now it's all set!

If you're interested in building your own (free!) blog using Jekyll and Github Pages, check out [Barry Clark's guide on *Smashing Magazine*](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

Looking around the site, there are lots of little things I want to improve. Pagination was a nice start, but also my banner is really boring. Should put up a photo with some snazzy looking text over it. All in good time. Sweeping changes often go wrong. I prefer little improvements, every day.
