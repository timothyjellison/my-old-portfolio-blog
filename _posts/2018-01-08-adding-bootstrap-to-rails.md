title: Adding Bootstrap to a Rails App
tags: Blog

This [post on the Launchschool website](https://launchschool.com/blog/integrating-rails-and-bootstrap-part-1) offers a quick and easy guide for adding the Bootstrap CSS framework to a Ruby on Rails application. I added it to [my toy app](https://frozen-ocean-34074.herokuapp.com/) this evening and updated the .erb files with some jumbotrons and containers, and in under 30 minutes everything's looking a lot smoother and is mobile ready.

2018 is off to a great start. I'm getting a lot done at work, have been getting a lot of good time in at the gym, and am writing code or writing about code every day. I'm learning a ton about Ruby and SQL and back-end dev more generally, which was one of my big goals for this year. And we're only eight days in! Looking forward to what the rest of the year will bring. ðŸ˜„
