I'm upping my Jekyll game by moving content editing and creation to [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/).

Developers like me who host their Jekyll website with GitHub Pages are comfortable creating content by updating HTML and Markdown files and pushing them up to GitHub. But that would never fly if you were building a Jekyll site for a client. A client needs a rich text editor for creating blog posts and an easy-to-use interface for editing copy. Handing over anything less would be bad business.

That's where CloudCannon comes in. CloudCannon connects to your wherever you're hosting your Jekyll site (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) and provides powerful, user-friendly tools. Besides a rich-text editor that makes writing blog-posts stupid easy, CloudCannon lets you add "editable regions" to your HTML for easy content updates on the fly. Just add class "editable" to a piece of markup and you can now use CloudCannon's web-based content editor instead of hardcoding text into your HTML files.

I highly recommend you give it a try. It's free for individual users and takes a matter of minutes to set up.
