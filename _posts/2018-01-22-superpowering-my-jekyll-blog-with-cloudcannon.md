I'm upping my Jekyll game by moving content editing and creation to CloudCannon.

Developers like me who host their Jekyll website with GitHub Pages are comfortable creating content by digging into the actual code, directly editing HTML and Markdown files and pushing them up to GitHub. But if you were building a Jekyll site for a client you couldn't realistically ask them to edit HTML and Markdown every time they wanted to add content. A client needs a rich text editor for creating blog posts and an easy-to-use interface for editing copy. Handing over anything less would be bad business.

That's where [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) comes in. CloudCannon connects to wherever you're hosting your Jekyll site (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) and provides powerful, user-friendly tools like a rich-text editor that makes writing blog-posts stupid easy and "editable regions" that make static page content updates a snap.&nbsp;

I highly recommend you give it a try. It's free for individual users and takes a matter of minutes to set up.
