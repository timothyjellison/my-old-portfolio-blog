title: Responsive Site with Flexbox (Part 1)
---

Here's [a responsive site I built with flexbox](http://www.timothyellison.com/examples/flexbox-news-site/) just this morning. I'm amazed how easy it was. I'll explore it in-depth in a follow-up post, but for now I'll point out that I did use one new flexbox property: *justify-content*.

The justify-content property accepts five possible values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around. Chris Coyier provides a great visual explanation in his [guide to flexbox on CSSTricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Be sure to check it out.

While I'm making recommendations, check out [Ben Frain's awesome book: *Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3*](https://www.amazon.com/Responsive-Web-Design-HTML5-CSS3/dp/1784398934). It's got really great explanations of how to use the latest advances in HTML and CSS on your web pages. It's a really fun read.
