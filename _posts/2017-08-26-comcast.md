I joined Comcast as a UI Engineer in September 2016 and it's been a really interesting, challenging, and rewarding job.

My team and I build web applications for residential Xfinity customers. Practically speaking, this means I'm working with Node, React, and a bunch of other JavaScript libraries and tools to build applications that let Comcast customers accomplish tasks that used to require a long customer service phone call. Want to change your cable package? You can do that with our apps. Moving to a new city and want to take your equipment with you? You can do that with our apps. Want to schedule an appointment to have a professional come and install your new cable and internet services? You get the idea.

The first page I worked on was the MyPlan page, which provides an overview of your account information and provides links to pages where you can edit your cable package, find a new package with upgraded services, and more.

This was the page I first learned React and Redux on. All the data you see in this page began as JSON responses to HTTP requests, was massaged and added to the Redux store using Redux Sagas, and then made it's way into the view using React components.

My second major project after MyPlan was the Movers flow, which allows customers to move their service, schedule an installation appointment at their new address, or cancel their service if they're moving to an area not served by Comcast.

This was a really interesting project because we got to use Redux Form to handle validation. We used React Datepicker for the calendar field and customized it to be more screenreader friendly. I also added predictive text to the address field, so as you start typing your address it hits an endpoint that returns a list of suggested addresses.

My time at Comcast continues to be an awesome learning experience, and I look forward to continuing to build great products with a great team.
