I joined Comcast as a UI Engineer in September 2016. It's by far the most interesting, challenging, and rewarding work I've done as a web developer.

My team and I build web applications for residential Xfinity customers. Practically speaking, this means I'm working with Node, React, and a bunch of other JavaScript tools and libraries to build applications that let Comcast customers perform *for themselves* the stuff you used to require a long customer service phone call. Want to change your cable package? You can do that with our apps. Moving to a new city and want to take your equipment with you? You can do that with our apps. Want to schedule an appointment to have a professional come and install your new cable and internet package? You get the idea.

Here's the first page I worked on after joining Comcast:

So this page is built with React. I knew absolutely *nothing* about React when I joined Comcast. I was totally up front about it in my interviews but they hired me anyway. So starting day one, it was all React all the time. 

Sink or swim time, friends. ðŸŒŠ

I watched a bunch of courses on Egghead.io, read through the React and Redux docs several times, and at the suggestion of a coworker played around with the React Slingshot app. With that equipment, in about a month I was able to take on real tasks, though I was *constantly* needing to ask my teammates Rodrigo Gualberto, Sandy Kaur, Joe Parisi, and Sunil Nuthalapati (among many others) for help.

They eased me into the work, starting by having me make changes to individual JSX components, then setting up container components to see how the state is pulled from the Redux store and then handed to the components as props. Then I learned how to use the Redux Saga library to reach out to our API for data and pass the returned data into the Redux store. Then I learned how we use axios to do that *actual* work of making calls to the API, and how Express is managing routing and HTTP requests and responses, and how the browser and caching and cookies really work, and about TCP/IP and WebSockets and performance testing and on and on and on. 

It's been an incredible learning experience, and there's always more to learn. I know that some people don't like constantly learning but I *love* that aspect of web development.
