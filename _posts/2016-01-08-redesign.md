In the past couple days I've built this blog with Jekyll, done some significant redesign on my homepage, and generally gotten this beast in gear. I'm looking forward to blogging here. I spoke with a guy at a Free Code Camp meetup just a few days ago and blogging was a big part of his coding story. Talking with him was really inspiring.
