title: Tutorial for jQuery Validation Plugin

I wrote up some documentation in order to learn a plugin I needed for work, which turned into a presentation I gave to the other developers on my team.

So here's the story behind this one. In March 2016 I accepted an offer to join MarketOne International as a Demand Generation Specialist, which basically meant I'd be making HTML emails and microsites for clients to use in Oracle's Eloqua platform. It was my first *real* developer job where I got to give 100% of my time to working on code rather than splitting my time between code and marketing or schedule management or media production. I was a bit scared but *completely* stoked.

The first challenge I encountered early on in the new job was needing to learn (quickly) all about HTML forms and form validation. The team already used a lot of jQuery so I thought I'd stay in the idiom and learn how jQuery can be extended to form validation. And *the* library for that was [jQuery Validation Plugin](https://jqueryvalidation.org/).

Second challenge: I didn't like JVP's documentation. üò¨  To be fair, I was a *total* noob and wasn't as comfortable then as I've become now with just diving into unfamiliar documentation. At the time, I needed something a little less free-form than a bunch of links to method and property definitions.

So I wrote my own! By explaining the library to myself in really simple language, I learned a lot about how to read docs, how client-side scripts work, and a ton about HTML forms.

When I showed it to John Potter, one of the lead devs on my team and an all-around awesome guy, he told me the team leads were organizing a series of lunch-and-learns and he asked me if I'd like to kick it off by presenting my tutorial. üò≤  Again, scared but stoked. I said h\*ck yes I'll do it and gave the presentation about a month later.
