title: "Putting Yourself Out There"

Starting over is difficult. I left an academic career track in 2012 to pursue a career in publishing, and now I'm setting that aside to pursue web development. It's exciting to begin something new (especially something I enjoy as much as coding), but as a person who's getting older, whose friends are all homeowners and have been working in the same field for nearly a decade, it's tough to commit to a new dream no matter how exciting it is. 

So I've kept it to myself, this dream of mine. Until yesterday.

Yesterday I put a post on Facebook offering my web dev services for free. I need the real-world experience, and people need websites. It was scary. Would anybody respond? Would people support me? Would they be weird about it?

People *did* respond. Three people want websites built, and I'm going to do the work for them. Two days ago I was just some guy slapping together demo sites to boost his portfolio; now I have clients.

My takeaway: wait until you're ready, but don't wait too long. Let people support you. Trust your friends to trust in you. Believe in your friends so that they can believe in you. Being yourself and committing to your happiness is tough; don't make it tougher by thinking you have to do it alone. Put yourself out there.
