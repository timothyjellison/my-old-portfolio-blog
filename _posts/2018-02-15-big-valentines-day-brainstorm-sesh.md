For a few days now I've wanted to set aside fifteen minutes to write down some project ideas and another fifteen minutes to write a new post here on my blog. In the spirit of Valentine's Day connubiality, I'm going to combine the two into one.
{: .present-before-paste}

1. I recently added a contact us form to my personal site using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and styled it using down a trimmed down version of [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) CSS framework (literally just copy pasted the handful of styles I wanted from Skeleton). The form's working great, and Skeleton gives me some good styling that's better than native and looks good across browsers and devices, but the aesthetic feels really thrown together. It doesn't match the rest of the page. I need to put on my Design Hat™ and get it looking slick.
2. I build web apps *every single day* at work but don't have an app of my own to show off. It's ridiculous. Even if it's just a [serverless](https://thepowerofserverless.info/) site that processes some form data and tells you what kind of electric guitar you should buy or what novel you should read, I should have something out there that shows off my React skills.
3. My [csvtoyaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtoyaml) package on npm is basically just a wrapper for two other packages, [csvtojson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson) and [json2yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2yaml), but it isn't as flexible as either. Currently you can only load csv formatted data into csvtoyaml by reading it from the file system. It's way too rigid and not open to all the possible use cases. You also can't use it from the command line which is a shame — I'll need to figure out how to make that work.
4. I started a github repository called [fave-resources](https://github.com/timothyjellison/fave-resources) that I'd like to put more attention into. Actually, what I'd really like to do is make a fave-resources database and API that my personal website can reach out to for data to populate a page with. That would be fun.

Alright, that's my fifteen minutes. Lots to think about, lots to work on. It's gonna be fun!
