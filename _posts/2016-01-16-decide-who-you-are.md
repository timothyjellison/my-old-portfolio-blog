In my last post I wrote about the difficulty of starting over in a new field and putting yourself out there. A sweeping life change can make you feel very self-conscious.

But it can also feel very *liberating*.

Something about starting afresh is that you can **choose who you want to be**. I faced this recently when reconsidering how I've been branding myself on my portfolio site. My copy said 'Tim Ellison - Junior Web Developer'. Not very strong, and not very accurate. 'Web Developer' is much too vague. I took some time to consider my strengths and weaknesses and the direction I want my career to go in. I love art *and* math. I value creativity and beauty and communication. I'm not just a developer; I'm a *front end developer*. So just like that, I decided to change my site to say 'Tim Ellison - Front End Developer'. It's more focused. It shows potential employers and clients exactly who I am and who I'm not. It's a small change, but it feels great. 

And no need to call myself a junior; that's just my impostor syndrome being a jerk. If you've got good taste, you'll be hard on yourself. That's a good thing, but don't be *too* hard on yourself. Enjoy the new life you've chosen for yourself. Decide who you are, and stick by your decision.
