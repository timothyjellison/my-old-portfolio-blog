I've had an awesome week. I've #crushed every challenge that's come my way. You know that feeling when you've been working out or practicing an instrument for a long time and you never seem to improve at all until - BAM - one day you're doing things you'd never think yourself capable of. That's been my week. ðŸ˜ƒ

At my day job at Comcast I've been pushing new features, creating proof-of-concept branches, fixing bugs, and helping my coworkers learn git and unit testing. It's nothing new but this week I felt like I was in command rather than keeping up. It's a good feeling.

I got my npm package&nbsp;[csvtoyaml](https://github.com/timothyjellison/csvtoyaml)&nbsp;100% covered by unit tests and integrated the repo with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to automate testing. The package has been downloaded at least a couple hundred times since I first published it three months ago.

I created a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site and deployed it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I registered a domain name with [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/)&nbsp;and updated the namespace records to point to my Netlify build. I created a staging environment so I can test the code out IRL before merging anything new to master.&nbsp;

There will be more good weeks, but there will be bad weeks and just OK weeks too. This week was a good one, and I'm not going to let that go. I'll remember it and take strength from it when times are hard.
