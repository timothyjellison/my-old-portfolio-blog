title: Breaking Ground
---

Today I broke ground on the first app I'm going to build from front to (gulp!) back. It's going to be a Goodreads clone running on a MERN model - Mongo, Express, React, and Node.

I use React and Node at work every day, so I'm not too worried about those. Express is a bit new to me; I've followed some tutorials and read through some guides, but never had to wire it up for a practical purpose. Mongo is a whole new world for me. Databases are probably the biggest gap in my knowledge, and I'm eager to fill that gap.

So far I've taken the following steps:

* Started a React app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

* Built a couple page components and tied them together using [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* Added some automatic scss compilation using [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [npm scripts](https://css-tricks.com/why-npm-scripts/)

* Pushed everything to [Github](https://github.com/timothyjellison/Library_App) and cloned my repo to  [c9.io](https://ide.c9.io/timothyjellison/library_app)

Things on my to do list:

* Plan out the full set of pages I'll need, and actually make them

* Plan out the shape of my API, and actually make it

* Set up redux to manage my app's state once I've called data from the API

* Sketch up a UX, maybe create some assets, just get in the zone with some CSS

* About 8 million other little things I probably don't even know about yet

My goal is to have a really ugly and hopefully only a little buggy version of the app working in the next two weeks. After that, I give myself a month to clean this beast up and release it into the world.
