I'm a UI engineer at Comcast in Philadelphia, where I work primarily on React web apps. I love all things web dev, from Node to the humble `<span>` tag. Outside of work I'm all about spending time with family and [keeping up with my goal of reading at least one book a week](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10453202-tim).
