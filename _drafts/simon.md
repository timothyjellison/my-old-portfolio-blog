I was cleaning up my GitHub repos and found I still had this Simon clone I built while completing the FreeCodeCamp coursework. It was one of the first things I ever put in my web dev portfolio, and it was enough to help pull me out of my marketing job I hated. It's a disastrous combo of Bootstrap and jQuery ðŸ¤£ Want to play?
