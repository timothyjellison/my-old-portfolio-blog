I've had an awesome week. I've #crushed every challenge that's come my way. You know that feeling when you've been running or practicing an instrument for a long time and you never seem to improve until - BAM - out of the blue you're capable of things you didn't even know you could do. That's been my week.

I got my [csvtoyaml](https://github.com/timothyjellison/csvtoyaml)&nbsp;npm package 100% covered by unit tests and integrated the repo with TravisCI to automate testing.
