I'm a book nerd first, computer nerd second.

I walk 45 minutes to and from work each day with my head in a book, and most days I'll use my 30 minutes lunch to go out and read a little more.

I read literary fiction and poetry mostly. Favorites writers? Rachel Cusk, Thomas Mann, Italo Calvino, Marilynne Robinson, Tom Stoppard, Julian Barnes, Penelope Fitzgerald, Stefan Zweig, Thom Gunn, and Mary Ruefle. To name a few. I left out the classics you've probably already heard of.

Last year I read Robertson Davies'&nbsp;*The Deptford Trilogy*. It was one of my favorite things I'd ever read, especially the first book in the series, entitled&nbsp;*Fifth Business*.&nbsp;
